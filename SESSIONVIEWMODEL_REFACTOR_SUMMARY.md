# SessionViewModel Refactoring Summary

## Overview
The SessionViewModel has been successfully refactored to use the new AudioService, following the separation of concerns pattern. All audio and speech recognition functionality has been delegated to the AudioService.

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed Direct Audio/Speech Properties
- Removed: `audioEngine`, `speechRecognizer`, `recognitionRequest`, `recognitionTask`, `speechSynthesizer`
- These are now managed internally by the AudioService

### 2. Added AudioService Dependency
- Added `audioService: AudioServiceProtocol` property
- Implemented dependency injection in the initializer for testing support
- Default initialization uses the concrete AudioService implementation

### 3. Updated Audio/Speech Method Calls
- `startRecording()` now calls `audioService.startRecording(language:)`
- `stopRecording()` now calls `audioService.stopRecording()`
- `speakText()` now calls `audioService.speakText(_:language:)`
- Permission requests now use `audioService.requestPermissions()`

### 4. Implemented Publisher Subscriptions
The SessionViewModel now subscribes to AudioService publishers:
- `isRecordingPublisher` → Updates `isRecording` state
- `currentTranscriptionPublisher` → Updates `currentUserText`
- `finalTranscriptionPublisher` → Triggers `processUserInput()`
- `errorPublisher` → Updates `errorMessage`

### 5. Removed Audio-Related Methods
The following methods were removed as they're now handled by AudioService:
- `setupSpeechRecognition()`
- `handleRecognitionResult()`
- `configureAudioSession()`
- `getLocaleIdentifier()` (moved to AudioService)

### 6. Updated Error Handling
- Errors from AudioService are now received through the error publisher
- Error messages are automatically displayed to the user

## Important Notes

### AudioService Integration Issue
**IMPORTANT**: The AudioService.swift file exists in the `OpenLangAI/Services/` folder but is not currently included in the Xcode project. As a temporary workaround, a minimal AudioService implementation has been included directly in the SessionViewModel.swift file.

**To complete the refactoring:**
1. Open the project in Xcode
2. Add the `Services` folder to the project
3. Ensure AudioService.swift is included in the OpenLangAI target
4. Remove the temporary AudioService implementation from SessionViewModel.swift
5. The proper AudioService in the Services folder includes additional features like AudioSessionMode enum and error types

### Test Updates
The SessionViewModelTests have been updated to:
- Use MockAudioService instead of individual mock components
- Test the new publisher-based communication
- Verify proper integration with the AudioService

## Benefits of the Refactoring

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Business logic is separated from audio/speech implementation details
2. **Testability**: Easy to mock AudioService for unit testing
3. **Reusability**: AudioService can be used by other view models
4. **Maintainability**: Audio/speech code is centralized in one service
5. **Flexibility**: Easy to swap audio implementations or add new features

## Next Steps

1. Add the AudioService.swift file to the Xcode project
2. Remove the temporary implementation from SessionViewModel.swift
3. Consider adding more audio features to the AudioService (e.g., audio recording, playback controls)
4. Implement additional error handling and recovery strategies
