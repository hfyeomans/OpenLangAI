## Recent Analysis and Refactoring (2025-06-27)

### User Request
"This project was meant to utilize GenAI services such as chatgpt, gemini, or Claude using an added API key from the user. The application would use the LLM to learn how to speak a new language using speech between the user and the LLM. Read the files PROJECT_STATE.md and PROJECT_FILE.md to learn more about the project and its current state. Use ultrathink and find challenges, refactoring opportunities, and issues related to the project. Locate mismatches across different parts of the codebase. Do not write any code at this time. Use Test Driven Development methodologies. Verify your thinking and details you provide. Use subagents to do independent testing. It is not clear if the app is utilizing one of the LLMs such as ChatGPT, gemini, or Claude and it is not working consistently. Create a comprehensive analysis plan. Write the plan to a file called CLAUDE_PLAN.md before writing any code."

### Analysis Completed
- Created comprehensive analysis plan in CLAUDE_PLAN.md
- Identified critical issues with LLM provider integration
- Found hardcoded ChatGPT usage despite UI showing multiple providers
- Discovered API key management limitations
- Documented lack of error handling and testing infrastructure

### Current Implementation Task
Following the recommended phases in CLAUDE_PLAN.md to fix critical issues and implement proper multi-provider support with TDD approach.
