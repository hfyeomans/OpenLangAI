# CODEX Suggestions for OpenLangAI

Below is a consolidated list of refactoring opportunities, known issues, and recommended fixes to improve code quality, architecture, and user experience. The suggestions are grouped by category.

---

## 1. Architecture & Design

- **Adopt MVVM**: Extract business logic, network calls, and data persistence into separate ViewModel (ObservableObject) classes. Keep SwiftUI views as declarative renderers only.
- **Dependency Injection**: Inject clients (`LLMClient`, `PersistenceController`, `KeychainHelper`, etc.) into ViewModels to improve testability and decouple concrete implementations.
- **Centralize Configuration & Constants**: Replace magic strings (e.g. UserDefaults keys, notification identifiers) with a `Constants` enum or struct. This reduces typos and makes key changes easier.
- **Encapsulate Feature Flows**: Refactor step-based onboarding (currently implemented via a `TabView` hack) into a dedicated coordinator or state-driven stepper. This simplifies navigation logic and improves maintainability.

## 2. SwiftUI & UI Components

- **Remove Direct UIKit/UIScreen Calls**: Avoid using `UIScreen.main.bounds` for layout. Prefer SwiftUI layout primitives (`GeometryReader`, `.frame(maxWidth: .infinity)`, etc.) to adapt to different screen sizes and orientations.
- **Resolve Deprecated APIs**: Update `.onChange(of:perform:)` usages to the new iOS 17 signature: use either zero-parameter or two-parameter closures (e.g. `.onChange(of: transcript.count) { newCount in ... }`).
- **Standardize Preview Providers**: Use consistent `struct ...: PreviewProvider` for all previews. Replace the new `#Preview` syntax or vice versa to match your Xcode version and style guide.
- **Minimize Inline Comments**: Remove commented-out code and TODO placeholders in production files. Git history and issue trackers should hold the context instead.

## 3. Speech & Audio

- **Fix Microphone Permission Request**: Replace `AVAudioApplication.requestRecordPermission` with `AVAudioSession.sharedInstance().requestRecordPermission(_:)`. The former is not a valid API.
- **Handle Speech Authorization Failures**: In `setupSpeechRecognition()`, present an alert or fallback UI when `SFSpeechRecognizer` authorization is denied instead of silently ignoring.
- **Isolate Audio Pipeline**: Move AVAudioEngine and Speech framework setup into a reusable `AudioRecorder`/`SpeechRecognizer` component. This avoids duplicating boilerplate and simplifies testing.
- **Manage AVAudioSession Lifecycle Carefully**: Ensure the audio session is deactivated only when appropriate, to avoid conflicts with other system audio (e.g. music playback).

## 4. Networking & LLM Integration

- **Abstract LLMClient Calls**: Create a `ConversationService` or `LLMService` that encapsulates prompting, error handling, streaming, and retry logic. Views and ViewModels should not call `LLMClient.shared` directly.
- **Implement Fallback to Whisper**: If on-device speech recognition confidence is low, stream audio buffers to Whisper as a fallback. Centralize this logic in the audio/speech service.
- **Stream Responses for Low Latency**: Leverage the async streaming API of GPT-4 to display partial responses as they arrive, improving perceived responsiveness.
- **Graceful API Key Validation**: In `OnboardingView`, decouple saving the key from validation. Validate the key in the background first, then save on success to prevent orphaned entries.

## 5. Data Persistence & Core Data

- **Migrate to SwiftData (Optional)**: Consider adopting SwiftData on iOS 17+ for simpler Core Data model definitions and reduced boilerplate. If staying on Core Data, remove ordered relationships (unsupported in SwiftData).
- **Use @FetchRequest**: Replace manual array population with SwiftUI’s `@FetchRequest` for conversations and messages. This ensures views stay in sync with the persistent store automatically.
- **Unify Conversation Lifecycle**: Avoid calling `endConversation(_:)` in both `onDisappear` and the “End Session” button. Rely on a single explicit lifecycle event to close sessions.
- **Encapsulate Persistence Operations**: Move all Core Data operations (create, add message, end conversation, add vocabulary item) into a dedicated repository or service class.

## 6. Localization & Internationalization

- **Extract Strings to Localizable.strings**: All UI text (labels, button titles, error messages) should be localized instead of hard-coded.
- **Extend Language Enum**: Add a `localeIdentifier` computed property to `Language` to replace duplicate switch statements in multiple views.

## 7. Error Handling & Logging

- **Surface Errors to Users**: Replace `print(...)` statements with user-facing alerts or toasts (e.g. using SwiftUI’s `Alert` or a custom overlay).
- **Centralize Logging**: Implement a `Logger` abstraction (e.g. using `os.Logger`) and use log levels. This makes it easier to enable/disable debug logging.

## 8. Testing

- **Unit Test ViewModels & Services**: Write tests for your new ViewModel and service classes by injecting mock implementations of `LLMClient`, `AudioRecorder`, and `PersistenceController`.
- **Add UI Tests for Flows**: Automate critical user flows (onboarding, voice conversation, session recap) using Xcode UI tests or a BDD framework.

## 9. Performance & Responsiveness

- **Debounce Transcript Updates**: Throttle or debounce rapid consecutive updates to `transcript` to avoid UI chattiness and improve scrolling performance.
- **Reuse AVSpeechSynthesizer**: Keep a single instance of `AVSpeechSynthesizer` in your speech service instead of creating a new one per utterance.

## 10. Code Style & Organization

- **Rename App Entrypoint File**: Rename `AppDelegate.swift` to `OpenLangAIApp.swift` to reflect the `@main struct OpenLangAI: App` inside.
- **Adopt SwiftLint / SwiftFormat**: Configure linting and formatting tools to enforce a consistent code style across the project.
- **Group Related Types**: Move `TranscriptEntry`, `TranscriptBubble`, `VocabularyCard`, and helper views into their own files under `Views/` for better discoverability.

## 11. Documentation & CI

- **Update README & Remove Outdated Files**: Synchronize the README with your latest code (e.g. remove references to `speechDelegate` if it no longer exists) and delete `xcode_errors.md` once errors are addressed.
- **Integrate Continuous Integration**: Add a CI workflow that runs `xcodegen generate`, builds the app, runs tests, and executes SwiftLint/SwiftFormat.
